Darwin:
       A robotic arm using Raspberry Pi and leap motion. This hand will be able to pick and throw objects. 
The functionality of Leap Motion to detect hand movements so the robotic arm will mimic it. 
This robotic arm responds to hand gestures. This has applications in industrial scenario and 
also in various automation scenarios where precise movements are required.

      Useful for people who are not capable of programming a robot for the automation. Anybody can just use
their hand to record the task which can be repeated then on. Industries can also employ multiples of these
arms under a network so that making changes would just include releasing a patch of updated task.
